Create a simple login web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Integrate the page with an open login API and implement form field validations. Ensure the login page is responsive and works well on both web and mobile devices. The HTML structure should include a form with username/email and password fields, along with a submit button. Style the form to be visually appealing and responsive using CSS, with adjustments for different screen sizes via media queries. JavaScript should handle client-side validations, ensuring the fields are not empty and meet the required formats, and display appropriate error messages. On form submission, a POST request should be sent to an open login API, handling the response to display success or error messages. Additionally, the login form should be responsive and function well on both web and mobile devices using responsive design principles. Optional bonus features include implementing show/hide password functionality, a remember me checkbox, and a loading spinner during the API call.
